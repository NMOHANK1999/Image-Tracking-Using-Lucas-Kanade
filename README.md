# Image-Tracking-Using-Lucas-Kanade
In the first section you will implement a simple
Lucas-Kanade (LK) tracker with one single template. The second section requires you to
implement a motion subtraction method for tracking moving pixels in a scene. In the final
section you shall study efficient tracking such as inverse composition. Other than the course
slide decks, the following references may also be helpful:
